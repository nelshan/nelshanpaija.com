          <p>I'm a passionate Unity Game Developer with hands-on experience in bringing game worlds to life in both 2D and 3D.
            Currently based in <strong>Pokhara, Nepal</strong>, my journey began with a deep love for gaming, which eventually
            evolved into a passion for game development. I graduated from
            <a class="underline-link" href="https://icp.edu.np/" target="_blank">Informatics College Pokhara</a>, which has a direct 
            partnership with 
            <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.londonmet.ac.uk/" target="_blank">London Metropolitan University, UK</a>, earning Second-Class Honours in 
            <a class="underline-link" href="https://icp.edu.np/bachelor-in-information-technology" target="_blank">BSc (Hons) Computing</a>.
          </p>
          <p>As a passionate indie Game Developer, I'm always excited to dive into new challenges and grow my skills.
             I specialize in C# and the Unity Engine, which I've used to create a variety of game prototypes and interactive
             experiences. While Unity is my primary tool, I believe in using the best tool for each project, and I'm always
             open to learning new technologies and techniques that can help bring my ideas to life. Whether it's scripting
             gameplay mechanics, optimizing performance, or designing engaging game environments, I'm committed to delivering
             the best results possible. As I continue to grow my knowledge and experience, I'm always looking for opportunities
            to collaborate and push the boundaries of what I can create in game development.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>If I'm not coding</strong>, I'm probably working on a personal project, participating in a game
            jam, or exploring the gorgeous scenery of my local area.
          </p> 
          <p>
            <strong>If you have a project in mind or are looking for a dedicated Unity developer, 
            please don't hesitate to reach out! I'm always excited to connect with fellow game enthusiasts and bring new ideas to life.</strong>

            A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Unity.This cellular automaton 
            devised by John Conway in 1970, simulates the evolution of cells based on simple rules, 
            resulting in complex patterns. Conway's Game of Life is a well-known example of a 
            zero-player game, meaning that once initialized, the system evolves autonomously.
