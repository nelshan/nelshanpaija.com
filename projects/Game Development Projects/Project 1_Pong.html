                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>This project presents the development of a faithful recreation of the classic Pong arcade game, implemented in 
                    Unity as a demonstration of core game development principles. The goal was to build a simple yet technically 
                    sound two-dimensional game that accurately captures the mechanics, look, and feel of the original Pong while 
                    showcasing proficiency in Unity, C#, and game design fundamentals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developed as a solo project, this clone features local two-player gameplay, responsive paddle movement, realistic 
                    ball physics, dynamic collision responses, and a scoring system where the first player to reach ten points wins. 
                    The project emphasizes clean architecture, modular scripting, and a smooth, polished play experience reflective of 
                    strong foundational skills in both technical and design aspects of game development.

                <h2>2. Concept and Design Goals</h2>
                <p>The inspiration for this project came from the original Pong released by Atari in 1972 — one of the earliest and 
                    most iconic video games in history. Its minimalist design and simple yet engaging gameplay make it an ideal 
                    candidate for demonstrating understanding of interactive systems, physics, and player feedback within a controlled scope.
                </p>
                <p>The primary design goals for this project were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Faithful Recreation:</strong> Replicate the visual simplicity and mechanics of the original Pong while ensuring modern responsiveness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Two-Player Mode:</strong> Enable two users to play simultaneously using the same keyboard.</li>
                    <li><strong>Realistic Physics:</strong> Implement consistent and natural ball motion using Unity’s 2D physics system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean Game Loop:</strong> Create a well-structured system for scoring, resetting rounds, and detecting victory conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Polished Feel:</strong> Achieve smooth input, fair collision detection, and clear visual communication through the user interface.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By focusing on these goals, the project aimed to balance authenticity with modern implementation practices and provide a foundation for future feature expansion.</p>

                <h2>3. Development Process</h2>

                <h3>3.1 Project Setup</h3>
                <p>
                    The project was initiated in Unity using the 2D template. The scene was composed of a camera centered on a playfield defined by 
                    static colliders representing the top and bottom walls. The core interactive elements included two paddles, a ball, and a 
                    UI system for displaying scores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The initial step was to define object layers and tag key entities to facilitate collision handling and scoring detection. 
                    A simple, monochrome color palette was chosen to evoke the original arcade aesthetic.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2 Paddle Movement</h3>
                <p>
                    Each paddle was assigned a dedicated controller script to handle vertical movement based on player input. 
                    Player One used the “W” and “S” keys, while Player Two used the Up and Down arrow keys. Input was processed 
                    per frame, and movement was clamped to prevent paddles from leaving the visible play area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The responsiveness of paddle controls was a critical factor. Early tests revealed the importance of 
                    frame-independent movement, achieved through the use of <strong>Time.deltaTime</strong> to ensure consistent behavior 
                    across varying frame rates.
                </p>

                <h3>3.3 Ball Physics</h3>
                <p>
                    The ball’s motion was driven by Unity’s <strong>Rigidbody2D</strong> component, utilizing velocity rather than position updates to 
                    maintain realistic interactions. When launched, the ball’s direction and speed were randomized within controlled 
                    limits to introduce variety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Collision handling was primarily physics-driven, with reflection logic applied based on the collision normal. 
                    This created a natural bounce effect against paddles and walls. To simulate skill-based gameplay, the angle of 
                    reflection was slightly influenced by the paddle’s movement direction at the moment of contact, allowing skilled 
                    players to “aim” their shots.
                </p>

                <h3>3.4 Scoring System and Game Loop</h3>
                <p>
                    Two invisible colliders positioned beyond each paddle acted as scoring zones. When the ball entered one, 
                    a point was awarded to the opposing player. The <strong>ScoreManager</strong> class maintained player scores and triggered 
                    round resets by repositioning the ball and reinitializing its velocity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a player reached ten points, the match concluded, and a victory message was displayed on the UI. 
                    A simple restart option allowed players to begin a new game seamlessly, reinforcing a continuous play loop.
                </p>

                <h3>3.5 User Interface</h3>
                <p>
                    The UI design emphasized clarity and simplicity. The current score for each player was displayed prominently 
                    at the center of the screen. The game over screen featured a single winner message and a restart prompt. Unity’s 
                    Canvas system was used for text and overlays, maintaining pixel-perfect alignment across resolutions.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Technical Implementation</h2>
                
                <h3>4.1 Architecture Overview</h3>
                <p>The project followed a modular script architecture, with key components divided as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Players:</strong> Handles player input, movement boundaries, and speed adjustment.</li>
                    <li><strong>BallMovement:</strong> Manages velocity, collisions, and trajectory calculations.</li>
                    <li><strong>ScoreManager:</strong> Oversees scoring, win conditions, and game resets.</li>
                    <li><strong>UIManager:</strong> Updates score displays and manages end-game messages.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each script maintained a single responsibility, improving code readability and reducing coupling between systems.</p>

                <h3>4.2 Collision Handling and Ball Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    The ball’s interaction system was designed to replicate real-world reflection behavior without introducing excessive randomness. The collision response used the following logic:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Retrieve the collision normal using <strong>collision.contacts[0].normal</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Calculate the reflection vector using <strong>Vector2.Reflect()</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Adjust ball velocity to maintain constant speed while reflecting direction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This ensured consistent and predictable bounces while still allowing for dynamic play based on paddle motion.</p>

                <h3>4.3 Input System and Control Responsiveness</h3>
                <p>
                    Unity’s default Input Manager was used to capture keyboard input for both players. 
                    To ensure responsiveness, paddle movement calculations were performed in <strong>Update()</strong> 
                    with physics updates handled separately in <strong>FixedUpdate()</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>A key design decision was to limit maximum paddle speed to maintain control precision while preserving the competitive pace of gameplay.</p>

                <h3>4.4 Game State Management</h3>
                <p>
                    The <strong>ScoreManager</strong> script served as the central authority for transitioning between game states (active round, scoring, game over). When a point was scored, the following sequence occurred:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increment score for the correct player.</li>
                    <li>Check for win condition (first to ten).</li>
                    <li>If no win, reset ball and continue play; if win, display results and pause ball movement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This structure ensured a consistent and controlled gameplay cycle, preventing unexpected behaviors between rounds.</p>

                <h3>4.5 Performance Considerations</h3>
                <p>
                    Although a lightweight project, optimization practices were followed. Object references were cached to 
                    reduce calls to <strong>FindObjectOfType</strong>, and unnecessary physics calculations were minimized by disabling 
                    rigidbody simulation during reset states. The final build maintained a consistent 60 frames per 
                    second across tests.

                <h2>5. Challenges and Problem-Solving</h2>

                <h3>5.1 Collision Accuracy</h3>
                <p>
                    A recurring challenge was ensuring precise collision responses between the ball and paddle edges. In early iterations, 
                    the ball occasionally slipped through paddle colliders at high speeds. The issue was mitigated by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enabling Continuous Collision Detection on the ball’s Rigidbody2D.</li>
                    <li>Increasing the physics update rate for critical collision checks.</li>
                    <li>Reducing ball acceleration per hit to prevent physics instability.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5.2 Gameplay Balance</h3>
                <p>
                    Fine-tuning ball speed and paddle responsiveness required extensive testing. Too slow, and the game lacked excitement; 
                    too fast, and control accuracy suffered. Through incremental adjustments, an optimal balance was achieved that rewarded 
                    player skill without overwhelming reaction time.
                </p>

                <h3>5.3 Code Maintainability</h3>
                <p>
                    During development, an early monolithic design led to difficulty managing interdependent game elements. 
                    Refactoring into a component-based structure improved maintainability and allowed for potential 
                    scalability, such as adding an AI opponent or advanced UI systems in the future.

                <h2>6. Testing and Iteration</h2>
                <p>
                    Testing involved multiple rounds of local playtesting to evaluate control feel, collision behavior, and pacing. Observations guided iterative improvements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adjusted ball launch speed variance for fairness.</li>
                    <li>Smoothed paddle acceleration to avoid abrupt movement.</li>
                    <li>Added reset delays between rounds for clarity and pacing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These iterations led to a polished and predictable play experience aligned with the project’s goals.

                <h2>10. Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    The Pong – 2D Arcade Game Clone served as both a technical exercise and a personal exploration of gameplay fundamentals. 
                    Through the development of this project, I deepened my understanding of Unity’s physics engine, refined my programming 
                    architecture skills, and learned how subtle design decisions impact player experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While small in scope, the project embodies key principles of game development: clarity, responsiveness, and iterative refinement. 
                    It stands as a demonstration of practical skill in creating interactive, well-structured, and enjoyable gameplay experiences — a 
                    foundation for more complex and ambitious game development endeavors.
