                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Flappy Bird Clone – Classic Arcade Game is a Unity-based recreation of the viral 2013 mobile hit Flappy Bird, 
                    developed to demonstrate proficiency in 2D game mechanics, physics-based gameplay, and polished user experience design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    he project’s goal was to faithfully replicate the addictive simplicity of the original game while showcasing 
                    understanding of Unity’s 2D physics engine, input handling, object pooling, and UI systems. Beyond recreation, 
                    the project served as a learning exercise in fine-tuning feel, difficulty balancing, and performance 
                    optimization — all essential skills for professional game development.

                <h2>2. Concept and Design Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    The original Flappy Bird achieved its enduring appeal through minimalist design and precise physics-based mechanics. 
                    Recreating it required a focus on accurate timing, responsive controls, and consistent difficulty progression.
                </p>
                <h3>Design Objectives:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Faithful Core Mechanics:</strong> Implement accurate flapping physics and obstacle patterns that capture the challenge of the original.</li>
                    <li><strong>Polished Controls:</strong> Ensure immediate, consistent player input for fluid gameplay.</li>
                    <li><strong>Endless Game Loop:</strong> Design a self-sustaining system for continuous play and scoring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Maintain stable performance through object pooling and lightweight physics operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear Visual Feedback:</strong> Create an uncluttered, readable interface suitable for mobile or desktop play.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The overarching design philosophy centered on simplicity, precision, and replayability — the same traits that made Flappy Bird both frustrating and irresistible.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="project-section">
                <h2>3. Development Process</h2>

                <h3>3.1 Project Setup</h3>
                <p>
                    The project was initiated in Unity’s 2D environment using orthographic camera projection for pixel-perfect visuals. 
                    The scene was structured around three main systems: Player, Obstacles, and Game Manager.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A limited color palette and simple sprites maintained the clean, cartoon-inspired aesthetic of the original. 
                    Early development focused entirely on player control and physics feel before introducing obstacles or scoring systems.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2 Player Movement and Physics</h3>
                <p>
                    The core mechanic — tapping to flap — was implemented using Unity’s Rigidbody2D component. 
                    The bird object received an upward impulse when the player pressed a designated key or 
                    screen tap, counteracted by gravity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A key challenge was achieving natural-feeling motion: too little force resulted in sluggish 
                    jumps; too much caused jerky motion. Through iterative tuning of the gravityScale and 
                    jumpForce parameters, a precise balance was established.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Collision detection was handled via 2D colliders, instantly triggering a “game over” state upon contact with pipes or the ground.
                </p>

                <h3>3.3 Obstacles and Level Progression</h3>
                <p>
                    Obstacle generation replicated the iconic pipe gaps from the original game. Pipes were instantiated at regular intervals with randomized vertical offsets to maintain variety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To ensure smooth performance, object pooling was used instead of continuous instantiation and destruction. This system recycled pipe pairs, resetting their positions once they exited the camera view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scrolling illusion was achieved by moving the environment leftward rather than advancing the player object. This simplified camera logic and kept gameplay deterministic.
                </p>

                <h3>3.4 Scoring and Game Loop</h3>
                <p>
                    A trigger collider placed between each pipe pair detected when the player successfully passed through, incrementing the score. The score was displayed via Unity’s UI Text system, updated in real time.
                </p>
                <p>The GameManager handled key game states:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start:</strong> Waiting for the player’s first input.</li>
                    <li><strong>Playing:</strong> Continuous gameplay with obstacle spawning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Game Over:</strong> Freezing movement, displaying score, and offering a restart option.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This loop ensured fluid transitions and minimal downtime between attempts, reinforcing the addictive “one more try” feedback cycle.</p>

                <h3>3.5 Visual and Audio Feedback</h3>
                <p>To enhance player experience, subtle animations and effects were added:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bird rotation adjusted dynamically to match velocity direction (tilting up when flapping and down when falling).</li>
                    <li>Background scrolling parallax created depth without performance cost.</li>
                    <li>Sound effects provided immediate feedback for flaps, collisions, and scoring.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These small details significantly increased immersion and satisfaction during repeated play.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="project-section">
                <h2>4. Technical Implementation</h2>

                <h3>4.1 Architecture Overview</h3>
                <p>The game was structured into clean, modular scripts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>BirdController – Handles input, flapping mechanics, and rotation.</li>
                    <li>PipeSpawner – Controls timing and positioning of obstacles.</li>
                    <li>ObjectPooler – Manages reusable pipe instances for efficiency.</li>
                    <li>GameManager – Oversees state transitions and restarts.</li>
                    <li>UIManager – Displays score and manages UI visibility.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This modular approach allowed for simple debugging and easy future modifications, such as adding new obstacles or themes.</p>

                <h3>4.2 Physics and Input System</h3>
                <p>
                    The physics system relied on Unity’s built-in components, fine-tuned for a specific “game feel”. 
                    Input was captured in the Update() loop to minimize delay, while flapping forces were applied in 
                    FixedUpdate() to maintain physics stability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To maintain deterministic behavior, random number seeds were controlled to ensure 
                    consistent obstacle spacing between sessions when needed (e.g., for testing difficulty).
                </p>

                <h3>4.3 Object Pooling and Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    Using object pooling for pipes and effects reduced memory allocation spikes and eliminated runtime garbage collection stutters. 
                    The system maintained a queue of inactive pipes that were repositioned as needed, ensuring smooth, continuous gameplay even on 
                    lower-end devices.
                </p>

                <h3>4.4 Game Balancing</h3>
                <p>
                    Game difficulty was tuned through careful adjustment of pipe gaps, spawn frequency, and gravity settings. 
                    Multiple iterations tested different pacing models, eventually settling on parameters that mirrored the 
                    original’s demanding but fair challenge curve.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Challenges and Problem-Solving</h2>

                <h3>5.1 Physics Tuning</h3>
                <p>
                    Achieving the “perfect feel” for flapping was the most critical and time-consuming challenge. 
                    Early iterations suffered from inconsistent motion and imprecise gravity application. Through 
                    continuous testing and frame-by-frame observation, ideal physics values were established to 
                    replicate the signature weight and responsiveness of Flappy Bird.
                </p>

                <h3>5.2 Obstacle Spawning Errors</h3>
                <p>
                    Initial versions occasionally generated overlapping or unevenly spaced pipes due to timing inconsistencies. 
                    This was resolved by implementing a timed coroutine that controlled spawn intervals independently from the 
                    frame rate, ensuring uniform pacing.
                </p>

                <h3>5.3 Game Reset and State Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Restarting the game cleanly posed early issues, as active coroutines and pooled objects retained outdated states. 
                    Refactoring the GameManager to handle centralized resets (clearing score, repositioning objects, and resetting physics) 
                    resolved these bugs.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="project-section">
                <h2>6. Testing and Iteration</h2>
                <p>
                    Testing involved repeated play sessions to refine movement physics, collision precision, and spawn logic. 
                    Each iteration introduced small adjustments, followed by hands-on evaluation for “feel” consistency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    User testing highlighted the importance of immediate restart capability — reducing downtime after failure 
                    significantly increased player engagement. These insights informed the final design loop, focusing on 
                    responsiveness and continuous challenge.

            <section class="project-section">
                <h2>7. Final Outcome</h2>
                <p>The completed Flappy Bird Clone successfully achieved its design and technical goals:</p>

                <p>
                    The Flappy Bird Clone – Classic Arcade Game stands as a concise yet comprehensive demonstration of 2D game development proficiency. 
                    By reconstructing a timeless mechanic from the ground up, this project showcases technical skill, design sensibility, and the 
                    importance of iteration in achieving satisfying gameplay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of Unity’s physics engine, optimized runtime performance, and refined my 
                    ability to translate abstract “feel” into tangible systems. While minimal in scope, this game encapsulates essential principles 
                    of professional game development — clarity, responsiveness, and precision — making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
