                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>LIGHTLESS is a 2D top-down survival horror shooter developed in Unity to explore the interplay between atmosphere, mechanics, and player psychology.</p>
                <p>
                    The project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in Unity development, including AI behavior systems, lighting design, player controls, and audio-driven immersion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The core objective of LIGHTLESS was to design a tension-driven experience where limited visibility, scarce resources, and unpredictable enemies 
                    create a sustained sense of vulnerability and suspense — fundamental traits of the survival horror genre.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="project-section">
                <h2>2. Concept and Design Philosophy</h2>

                <h3>2.1 Core Idea</h3>
                <p>
                    At its heart, LIGHTLESS is about fear through limitation. Instead of relying on jump scares or scripted events, 
                    the game uses environmental constraints and mechanical pressure to evoke dread. The player must navigate through 
                    a dark, decaying environment with limited ammunition and a small field of vision provided by a flickering flashlight.
                </p>

                <h3>2.2 Design Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Immersion:</strong> Create a believable, oppressive atmosphere through lighting, sound, and pacing.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI Unpredictability:</strong> Design enemy behavior that feels intelligent and threatening without being unfair.</li>
                    <li><s<trong>Smooth Controls:</strong> Ensure responsive top-down aiming, shooting, and movement to support precision under pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Build modular systems suitable for future content or procedural generation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The guiding design philosophy was “less is more” — minimal UI, deliberate pacing, and strategic resource balance.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="project-section">
                <h2>3. Development Process</h2>
                <p>The development of LIGHTLESS followed an iterative and modular workflow, allowing experimentation with atmosphere and mechanics in parallel.</p>
                
                <h3>3.1 Early Prototyping</h3>
                <p>The first prototype focused on core controls — player movement, aiming, and shooting.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented Unity’s 2D physics for movement and collision.</li>
                    <li>Added twin-stick control support for smooth aiming (keyboard/mouse or controller).</li>
                    <li>Integrated a basic lighting setup using Unity’s 2D Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and dynamic lights.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This phase established the essential feel of the player’s movement and vision, which dictated later design choices.</p>

                <h3>3.2 Core Systems</h3>
                <p>Once the player foundation was stable, I expanded development into the following systems:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Player System</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>360° aiming and shooting using raycasts or projectile physics.</li>
                            <li>Flashlight tied to the player’s facing direction, dynamically flickering to heighten anxiety.</li>
                            <li>Health and stamina systems encouraging cautious exploration.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>Enemy AI</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implemented a finite state machine (FSM) with patrol, chase, and attack states.</li>
                            <li>Enemies use raycast-based vision cones to detect the player through light and movemen</li>
                            <li>Sound-based attraction mechanic: gunshots or running can draw nearby enemies.</li>
                            <li>AI parameters (speed, aggression, vision range) adjustable via scriptable objects for fine-tuning.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Lighting and Atmosphere</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dynamic 2D lights simulate claustrophobic spaces.</li>
                            <li>Global light intensity adjusts subtly based on player health or proximity to enemies.</li>
                            <li>Occasional light flickers and power failures simulate psychological unease.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Audio System</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Layered ambient soundscapes and procedural sound triggers (e.g., footsteps, breathing).</li>
                            <li>Directional 2D audio cues for approaching enemies.</li>
                            <li>Randomized sound events maintain tension even in quiet moments.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Combat and Resource System</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Limited ammo and reloading mechanics.</li>
                            <li>Damage feedback through screen tint and camera shake.</li>
                            <li>Lootable containers placed strategically to balance challenge and reward.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                      </tr>

                  </table>
                <p>This modular design allowed me to tweak systems independently, which was crucial for testing horror pacing.</p>

                <h3>4.2 Lighting System</h3>
                <p>LIGHTLESS relies heavily on Unity’s 2D lighting and post-processing stack.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each enemy and environmental element interacts with dynamic light.</li>
                    <li>The player’s flashlight uses an animated intensity curve to simulate irregular battery behavior.</li>
                    <li>A fog overlay shader adds depth and obscures visibility at distance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4.3 AI Behavior</h3>
                <p>The AI uses a state-based system structured around Unity’s Update() loop:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-csharp">
                        switch (currentState)
                        {
                            case Patrol: PatrolArea(); break;
                            case Chase: ChasePlayer(); break;
                            case Attack: AttackPlayer(); break;
                        }                                     
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Transitions between states are triggered by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Distance to the player.</li>
                    <li>Visibility (line of sight).</li>
                    <li>Sound events within a detection radius.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This system produces emergent, unpredictable encounters, increasing replayability and tension.</p>

                <h3>4.4 Optimization</h3>
                <p>Because multiple dynamic lights and AI agents can tax performance, several optimizations were employed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Object pooling for projectiles and particle effects.</li>
                    <li>Distance-based deactivation for off-screen enemies.</li>
                    <li>Light culling masks to limit active illumination zones.</li>
                    <li>Minimal physics calculations via simplified colliders and kinematic movement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These measures ensure smooth frame rates, even in dense or effect-heavy environments.</p>

                <h2>8. Insights and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>Developing LIGHTLESS provided valuable insights into both design and engineering:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Atmosphere is a System: Lighting, sound, and pacing must be treated as interacting systems, not separate layers.</li>
                    <li>AI Design Requires Imperfection: Slight randomness and delay make enemies feel more human and unpredictable.</li>
                    <li>Player Feedback is Emotional Feedback: Every animation, light flicker, or sound cue contributes to the player’s mental state.</li>
                    <li>Modularity Accelerates Creativity: Building loosely coupled systems enabled rapid experimentation without technical debt.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project reinforced the importance of emergent design, where behavior and emotion arise naturally from rule-based systems.</p>
