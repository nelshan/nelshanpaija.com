                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    This project presents the development of Space Invaders – Classic Arcade Shooter Clone, a Unity-based recreation of 
                    the 1978 arcade classic originally developed by Tomohiro Nishikado. The objective was to reproduce the essential 
                    gameplay mechanics and aesthetic of the original while showcasing proficiency in game programming, system design, 
                    and production workflow within Unity’s 2D environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game features dynamic enemy movement, responsive player controls, projectile-based combat, level progression, 
                    and a scoring system that rewards accuracy and survival. The project also integrates modular scripting, efficient 
                    object management, and an iterative design approach that balances authenticity with modern polish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developed as a solo project, Space Invaders Clone demonstrates not only technical competence but also an 
                    understanding of player experience, difficulty pacing, and iterative problem-solving throughout the development cycle.

                <h2>2. Concept and Design Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    The core inspiration stemmed from the enduring legacy of Space Invaders — a simple yet groundbreaking shooter 
                    that helped define the arcade era. The minimalist structure and escalating tension of the original provided an 
                    ideal foundation for exploring fundamental game mechanics such as movement systems, enemy behavior, 
                    and state-based progression.
                </p>
                <p>The key design goals for the project were as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Faithful Core Mechanics: Recreate the signature enemy wave behavior, player shooting, and scoring system.</li>
                    <li>Smooth Controls: Deliver responsive horizontal movement and accurate shooting.</li>
                    <li>Dynamic Difficulty: Implement progressive challenge through enemy speed, fire rate, and formation patterns.</li>
                    <li>Modular Code Design: Structure scripts for maintainability and scalability.</li>
                    <li>Visual Clarity and Feedback: Ensure clear communication of player actions, collisions, and outcomes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The design philosophy emphasized clarity, responsiveness, and progression. Every feature, from enemy formation speed to projectile timing, was tuned to sustain tension and reward player skill.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="project-section">
                <h2>3. Development Process</h2>

                <h3>3.1 Project Setup and Scene Composition</h3>
                <p>The Unity 2D template provided the foundation for the project. The scene layout included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A player ship positioned near the bottom of the screen.</li>
                    <li>A grid of enemy invaders arranged in multiple rows.</li>
                    <li>Protective bunkers acting as destructible barriers.</li>
                    <li>A UI layer displaying score, lives, and level indicators.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unity’s built-in physics and collision systems were selectively employed for simplicity, while certain interactions (like projectile-enemy collisions) were handled manually for performance and control.</p>

                <h3>3.2 Player Movement and Shooting</h3>
                <p>
                    The player’s ship could move horizontally within screen boundaries using left and right arrow keys, 
                    with spacebar triggering projectile firing. Movement speed was tuned through frame-independent 
                    motion using <strong>Time.deltaTime</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To prevent projectile spamming, a cooldown timer was introduced, ensuring only one active player 
                    bullet could exist at a time — mirroring the limitation of the original Space Invaders. This design 
                    choice encouraged precision and timing over rapid-fire mechanics.
                </p>

                <h3>3.3 Enemy Behavior and Formation System</h3>
                <p>
                    Enemies were organized in a hierarchical structure controlled by an Enemy Formation Manager. 
                    This manager dictated synchronized horizontal movement for the entire formation, reversing 
                    direction upon reaching screen boundaries and stepping downward incrementally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the number of enemies decreased, the formation’s movement speed and attack frequency 
                    increased, dynamically scaling difficulty. Each enemy type (e.g., basic, medium, elite) 
                    had unique point values, creating a risk-reward balance for targeting specific rows.
                </p>

                <h3>3.4 Projectile and Collision Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Both player and enemy projectiles were managed through an Object Pooling System to optimize performance. 
                    This approach avoided repeated instantiation and destruction of bullets, maintaining a stable frame 
                    rate even during heavy fire sequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Collision detection employed Unity’s <strong>OnTriggerEnter2D</strong> method, triggering destruction effects, 
                    score updates, and visual feedback (e.g., brief explosion sprites).
                </p>

                <h3>3.5 Game Progression and Scoring System</h3>
                <p>
                    The scoring system rewarded points based on enemy type, with cumulative totals displayed in the UI. 
                    Once all enemies were defeated, the game advanced to a new wave featuring increased speed, firing 
                    rates, and slightly altered formation patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the enemies reached the player’s defensive line or the player lost all lives, the game 
                    entered a Game Over state with the option to restart. This loop maintained the arcade-style 
                    replayability central to the original experience.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Technical Implementation</h2>

                <h3>4.1 Code Architecture</h3>
                <p>The project’s codebase followed a modular architecture focused on separation of concerns. The primary classes included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PlayerController – Handles input, movement, and firing logic.</li>
                    <li>EnemyController – Governs individual enemy behavior and interactions.</li>
                    <li>FormationManager – Controls collective enemy motion and progression logic.</li>
                    <li>Projectile – Defines bullet properties, collisions, and recycling via object pooling</li>
                    <li>GameManager – Manages global game state, score tracking, and transitions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This modular design improved clarity, simplified debugging, and provided a scalable base for future features like power-ups or new enemy types.</p>

                <h3>4.2 Enemy Movement and Timing System</h3>
                <p>
                    Enemy movement timing was coordinated using coroutines, ensuring smooth synchronized steps across the formation. 
                    The logic adjusted movement speed based on remaining enemy count, reproducing the original’s signature pacing 
                    where tension increases as fewer invaders remain.
                </p>

                <h3>4.3 Object Pooling</h3>
                <p>
                    Performance optimization was achieved through an object pooling pattern. Both player and enemy bullets were 
                    stored in reusable lists, minimizing memory allocation spikes and garbage collection overhead. This was particularly 
                    beneficial in scenarios with continuous firing and multiple active projectiles.
                </p>

                <h3>4.4 Visual and Audio Feedback</h3>
                <p>Although minimalist in style, subtle effects enhanced the sense of impact and immersion:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Screen flash or sprite color shift upon enemy hit.</li>
                    <li>Brief explosion animations upon destruction.</li>
                    <li>Background music loop with rhythmic tempo matching the pace of gameplay.</li>
                    <li>Distinct audio cues for shooting, hits, and movement reversals.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These sensory feedback elements reinforced player engagement while maintaining the classic retro tone.</p>

                <h2>5. Challenges and Problem-Solving</h2>

                <h3>5.1 Synchronizing Enemy Movement</h3>
                <p>
                    A key challenge was maintaining formation integrity while allowing individual enemies to be destroyed. 
                    Early versions caused desynchronization when enemies were removed from the hierarchy. The solution 
                    involved decoupling position updates from the parent transform and referencing a shared movement 
                    controller, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of which enemies remained.
                </p>

                <h3>5.2 Balancing Difficulty</h3>
                <p>
                    Determining appropriate difficulty scaling required multiple playtesting iterations. Initially, enemies 
                    accelerated too abruptly, making later stages nearly impossible. By refining acceleration curves and firing 
                    probabilities, the final system achieved a smoother, more rewarding difficulty progression.
                </p>

                <h3>5.3 Managing Projectile Collisions</h3>
                <p>
                    Simultaneous projectile collisions led to performance spikes during high activity. 
                    Transitioning to object pooling and simplifying hit detection logic resolved these 
                    issues and stabilized gameplay.
                </p>

            <section class="project-section">
                <h2>6. Testing and Iteration</h2>
                <p>
                    Testing followed an iterative loop of implementation, playtesting, and tuning. Core 
                    parameters such as player speed, bullet cooldown, and enemy drop intervals were adjusted 
                    continuously based on play feedback and performance metrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this process, the game evolved from a functional prototype to a balanced, engaging 
                    shooter experience. Each iteration enhanced not just gameplay balance but also user experience 
                    elements such as clarity of feedback and pacing.

                <p>
                    The completed Space Invaders – Classic Arcade Shooter Clone successfully replicates the 
                    feel and challenge of the original while incorporating modern development practices. 
                    The final game includes:

                <p>
                    Space Invaders – Classic Arcade Shooter Clone serves as both a technical and creative exercise in reimagining a 
                    timeless arcade experience within a modern development framework. Through disciplined design, iterative testing, 
                    and thoughtful technical architecture, the project achieved its goals of replicating authentic gameplay while 
                    demonstrating mastery of Unity’s 2D systems and efficient coding practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond recreating a classic, the project reinforced the importance of structured iteration, clean architecture, 
                    and the delicate balance between precision and playability. It stands as a testament to both the enduring appeal 
                    of simple mechanics and the power of disciplined craftsmanship in game development.
